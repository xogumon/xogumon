My name is Valdir Ronis, but you can call me Xogum (Shogun) or Ronis, I'm 34 and I'm from Fortaleza, CearÃ¡.  
I currently live in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, where I work as a freelance full-stack developer.

My life as a developer started in the late 90's, building small websites in PHP for my hobby.  
Today I'm more excited about JavaScript and its thousands of frameworks available on the web, like React, for example.
